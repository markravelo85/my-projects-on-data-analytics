# my-projects-on-data-analytics
#Hi good morning to everyone:
On this repository I show my final project for Data Analysis where consists on 4 archives in which I'll explain below: 
1. A csv database from Excel called "events": Over this dataset it's about information from a electronic store online, where has the main registers about:
Event time (the time period or date where the user do an action over the website),
Event type (the type or action done by the user: view, purchase, cart or shopping cart),
Product id,
Category id,
Category code (the main category which the product belongs to),
Brand (the name of the brand),
User id,
User session (It's an alphanumeric name that can represent the user's name).

2. With this database it's treated on python-pandas archive called (Final Python Project.ipynb), which I use data wrangling to clean and eliminate not-null registers
and I make data analysis in order to show which brands. categories codes are most purchased and if they have a certain relationship with its price using
one of the machine learning methods about supervised learning called "linear regression".

3. After this, there's an archive called "Proyecto final SQL1.ipynb" where I connect with mysql server in order to create the new database and import the table to MySQL
while using pandas to clean and eliminate not-null registers to ensure data integrity, after it creates the schema of the table on mySQL that helps to make querys on
mysql to get statistical information about it.

4. Connecting the csv archive ("events") with Tableau it's showed on the archive called "Dashboard proyecto final.twbx" where in a Tableau archive, shows 4 graphics about:
Categories and brands most purchased
Low purchased brands
Users with most purchases
Most purchased dates
