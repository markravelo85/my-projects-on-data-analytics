#Hi good morning to everyone:
On this repository I show my final project for Data Analysis where consists on 4 archives in which I'll explain below: 
1. A csv database from Excel called "events": Over this dataset it's about information from a electronic store online, where has the main registers about:
event time (the time period or date where the user do an action over the website)
event type (the type or action done by the user: view, purchase, cart or shopping cart)
product id
category id
category code (the main category which the product belongs to)
brand (the name of the brand)
user id
user session (It's an alphanumeric name that can represent the user's name)
2. With this database
